#' Initialize a Stack
#'
#' @description
#'
#' The `stacks()` function initializes a `data_stack` object. Principally,
#' `data_stack`s are tibbles, where the first column gives
#' the true outcome in the assessment set, and the remaining
#' columns give the predictions from each candidate ensemble
#' member. (When the outcome is numeric, thereâ€™s only one column per candidate
#' member. For classification, there are as many columns per candidate
#' member as there are levels in the outcome variable minus 1.) They also bring
#' along a few extra attributes to keep track of model definitions, resamples,
#' and training data.
#'
#' See `?stacks_description` for more discussion of the package, generally,
#' and the `basics` vignette for a detailed walk-through of functionality.
#'
#' @param ... Additional arguments. Currently ignored.
#'
#' @return A `data_stack` object.
